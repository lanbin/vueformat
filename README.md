This is a really simple plugin for sublime to format vue file(mean .vue file)

## Thanks

[js-beautify](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify)  
[standard-format](https://github.com/maxogden/standard-format)

## Usage

open `Package Control` -> `Install Package` -> `VueFormat`

open __.vue__ file, use `command + shift + h`

## Execuse

This plugin is reallllly simple one. It's totally based on [HTML-CSS-JS Prettify](https://github.com/victorporof/Sublime-HTMLPrettify). But change the Javascript formatination to `Standard`.  
At present, it works and still to improve.
